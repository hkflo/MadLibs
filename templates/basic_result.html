            <p>Our day started out like every other {{holiday_1}}. The whole family gathered around the {{noun_1}}. {{name_1}} brought out a plate of {{noun_2}} and some {{plural_noun_1}}. A few minutes later, everyone started to {{verb_1}}. Everything seemed {{adjective_1}}, until {{name_2}} brought up politics. Apparently {{noun_3}} was a complete lie, and the {{adjective_2}} {{name_3}} was running a secret pizza making scheme!! My aunt was not having it. My aunt got out of her chair and started to fight {{name_3}}! They {{past_tense_verb_1}} and {{past_tense_verb_2}} for a few minutes before {{name_2}} got knocked out. In the end, {{holiday_1}} was cancelled! What a horrible day.</p>
