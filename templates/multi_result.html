            <p>My {{family_member_1}} got a new doll yesterday! They picked out a {{adjective_1}} {{clothing_item_1}} and a {{adjective_2}} {{clothing_item_2}} for her new best friend. My {{family_member_1}} took her to {{location_1}} and {{location_2}}. But after we came back from {{location_2}} something seemed differentâ€¦ every time we turn our heads, the doll moves a few steps. And this morning when we woke up she was in the {{room_1}}!</p>
